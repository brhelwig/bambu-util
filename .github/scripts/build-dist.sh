# Builds and packages bambu-util for released platforms. ci runs it on every
# change and release runs it for each version, so a target that stops building
# fails a pull request rather than a release.
#
# Usage: build-dist.sh VERSION OUTDIR PLATFORM...
#        build-dist.sh checksums OUTDIR
#
# PLATFORM is os/arch as the release assets name it. Each builds natively on a
# runner of its own OS: linux/* on Linux with musl-gcc (from musl-tools), so the
# binaries are static; windows/* on Windows with MSVC; darwin/* on macOS.
