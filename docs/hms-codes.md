# HMS error codes

The printer's `hms` report field is a list of `{attr, code}` integer pairs.
`p1s.FormatHMSCode` renders each as four dash-grouped hex words
(`AAAA-AAAA-CCCC-CCCC`), which is the key used in `hmsMessages`
(`internal/p1s/hms_codes.go`). The top byte of `attr` identifies the module.

Only **1** of the **4908** codes below currently has a friendly message
(`0300-8000-0003-0002`); everything else shows the raw code in the banner.

| Module byte (top byte of `attr`) | Module |
|---|---|
| `03` | Motion controller (mc) |
| `05` | Mainboard |
| `07` | AMS |
| `08` | Toolhead |
| `0C` | Chamber camera / xcam |
| `12`, `18` | Not documented in ha-bambulab (labelled "unknown" there) |

Severity is the top 16 bits of `code` (1 fatal, 2 serious, 3 common, 4 info);
the server does not currently surface it.
