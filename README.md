# bambu-util

A web bridge for controlling a Bambu Lab P1S from a phone browser.

Browsers can't talk to the printer directly (MQTT over TLS on :8883, a
proprietary camera stream on :6000), so bambu-util runs on a machine on the
same network, holds those connections, and serves a mobile web page.

## Features

**Controls**

- Bed down (absolute move to Z200), Home (`G28`), Extrude and Unload
- Bed-drying and nozzle temperature sliders with material presets
- Pause, Resume and Stop for a running print (Stop asks for a second tap)
- Chamber lamp toggle

Bed, temperature and filament actions are refused server-side unless the
printer is idle (`IDLE`, `FINISH` or `FAILED`), and print controls are refused
unless they match the printer's state.

**Status and camera**

- Connection, printer state, bed/nozzle temperatures, progress, job name,
  layer and time remaining
- AMS trays (colour, material, nozzle range) and desiccant grade (A–E)
- Printer errors shown as readable messages, translated from HMS and
  `print_error` codes
- Chamber camera at ~1 fps, recorded into a rolling buffer (1 GB by
  default; the oldest frames go first). The view follows the live image; a
  scrub bar goes back through the buffer. During a print it starts 5 minutes
  before the print did.
- Recent prints are listed under the camera and can be played back as a
  timelapse at 30x, 60x, 300x or 600x, for as long as their footage is still
  in the buffer.

bambu-util keeps the camera connection open the whole time it runs. The
printer serves only one camera client, so Bambu Studio's camera view won't
work alongside it.

**Automation**

- Heaters turn off automatically after a delay (bed 24h, nozzle 15m by
  default)
- The chamber lamp turns on when a print starts or a heater is set, and off
  8h (by default) after the printer goes idle. The manual toggle is never
  overridden.

**Notifications**

Web push to subscribed devices: print started, finished or failed; printer
errors (including filament runout); and a repeating reminder while the bed is
hot with no print running. Each device chooses which it wants. Requires HTTPS;
on iPhone/iPad it also requires iOS 16.4+ and the page added to the Home
Screen.

**Settings and diagnostics**

- A Settings screen for the printer connection, notifications, how much
  camera history to keep (1 GB by default), auto-off delays, event log size,
  login length, theme (light/dark/system), and which status sections are shown
  and in what order. Changes apply when saved.
- Saving a printer first checks it answers, and says what is wrong if it
  doesn't (address, access code or serial).
- An Events screen listing commands sent, printer acknowledgements and
  reports, and notifications sent, each with the raw message. It is stored in
  the database (64 MB by default) so it survives restarts.
- Once camera history reaches its size, the oldest frames are deleted first.
- Can be added to the iOS Home Screen as a full-screen app.

## Printer setup

Recent P1 firmware rejects third-party G-code unless **LAN Only Mode** and
**Developer Mode** are both enabled on the printer. Status and camera work
without them; the controls need them.

You will need the printer's IP address and access code (printer screen,
Settings → WLAN) and its serial number (Settings → Device). These are entered
on the Settings page, not in the environment.

## Running

From source, with [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed (the version is pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml` and fetched automatically):

```sh
AUTH_DISABLED=true cargo run --release
```

Then open `http://<host>:8081`, go to Settings and enter the printer details.

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows (amd64 and arm64) are attached
to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/brhelwig/bambu-util/releases).

A container image is published for linux/arm64:

```sh
mkdir -p data
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e AUTH_DISABLED=true -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data" \
  ghcr.io/brhelwig/bambu-util:latest
```

The image runs as a non-root user, so the mounted directory must be writable
by the user it runs as.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `latest` | The newest build of `main` |
| `YY.DOY.M` | A release, e.g. `26.279.907`: year, day of year, minute of day (UTC) |
| `<commit sha>` | The build of that commit on `main` |

Every commit to `main` that passes CI is released.

## Configuration

Everything except the following is set on the Settings page and stored in the
database.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8081` | Address to listen on |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Directory for the SQLite database |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | | OpenID Connect issuer URL, e.g. `https://id.example.com` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | | OIDC client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | | OIDC client secret |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | | The URL the app is reached at, e.g. `https://printer.example.com` (scheme and host only) |
| `AUTH_DISABLED` | | Set to `true` to run without a login |

**The app will not start until authentication is configured.** Either set all
four of `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` and `PUBLIC_URL`,
or set `AUTH_DISABLED=true`.

### Login

Any OpenID Connect provider should work; it was developed against
[Pocket ID](https://pocket-id.org). Register a confidential client with the
redirect URI `<PUBLIC_URL>/auth/callback`. Anyone the provider lets log in to
that client gets in, so restrict access at the provider (in Pocket ID, with
the client's allowed user groups).

The issuer is checked at startup, so a wrong URL fails immediately. Cookies
are marked `Secure` when `PUBLIC_URL` is `https`. Logins last 14 days from
last use by default (configurable in Settings).

### Data

`DATA_DIR` holds `bambu-util.sqlite`: the camera buffer, event log, settings
(including the printer's access code), notification subscriptions and pending
auto-off timers. Put it on a persistent volume: losing it also loses the push
signing key, which unsubscribes every device. The database uses WAL mode, so
back up the `-wal` and `-shm` files along with it.

**Upgrading from the Go version** (releases before the Rust rewrite): the
database starts afresh. Enter the printer details on the Settings page again
and turn notifications back on on each phone; the old `bambu-util.db` can be
deleted.

## Security

With OIDC configured, everything requires a login except `/healthz` and the
few static files a phone fetches before logging in (service worker, manifest,
icons). With
`AUTH_DISABLED=true`, anyone who can reach the port can control the printer and
watch the camera, so only run it that way on a trusted network (LAN or
tailnet).

The printer's access code is stored in the database, so treat `DATA_DIR` as
sensitive. The page is never sent the code back, only whether one is set.

## Development

```sh
cargo test                      # everything, against a fake printer
cargo clippy --all-targets      # lints
cargo run --example fake_printer
```

The fake printer serves the printer's MQTT and camera ports on 127.0.0.1 with
a print under way. Run the app alongside it (`AUTH_DISABLED=true cargo run`) and
set the printer to `127.0.0.1`, serial `FAKE0001`, access code `12345678`.

The page gets its live data — status, the camera, recent prints — over one
websocket at `/api/live`; everything else is plain HTTP.

## Protocol notes

- **MQTT:** TLS on :8883, username `bblp`, password is the LAN access code,
  self-signed certificate. Status arrives on `device/<serial>/report`. After
  the initial `pushall` the printer only sends changed fields, so reports are
  merged into a cached state.
- **Camera:** TLS on :6000. The client sends an 80-byte auth packet (`0x40`,
  `0x3000`, then the username and access code, each zero-padded to 32 bytes).
  The printer then sends JPEG frames, each preceded by a 16-byte header whose
  first four bytes are the little-endian image size. Based on
  [ha-bambulab](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab)'s chamber-image
  client.
